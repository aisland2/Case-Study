# Case-Study Heroku
Good ways Heroku could be used to implement its CI for testing solutions is how it has a test decoy with every push on your GitHub repositories. Another way is how it runs your tests without configurations, but allows you to customize what tests you want to run or not.  These two are just a few ways that make it tons easier to test constantly and efficiently.

For each technology with Heroku, each has a place in testing. The Pipeline belongs to all test environments for example, since it allows you to review, develop, stage and produce your tests. The CI system fits into the QA environment, since it allows multiple and quick tests to be done alongside your Staging environments to help fix problems swiftly if they arise in your coding. The Review App is a development environment tool as it allows you to see what your code does from a temporary source and when it goes right and is merged, goes straight to staging. One last technology, the ChatOp, goes from Staging to Production environments if needed. It looks through code changes and allows the team to keep an eye out in case of a mess up.

Ways I could see myself using Heroku for an online game project is to have it help for verification with my coding. The entirety of Heroku is amazing at managing tests for applications and could very well keep my codes clean and able to be found and utilized correctly as I continue building the app up.
